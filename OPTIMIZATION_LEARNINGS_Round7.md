# Optimization Learnings - Round 7 (October 2025)

## Context
Round 7 focused on **increasing trade frequency** while maintaining profitability across a **diverse set of 12 random 2-week periods** throughout 2024. This was a shift from Rounds 1-6 which used 6-8 selective periods.

**Key Objective:** Achieve 60% success rate (8/12 periods) + 5+ trades/day

**Result:** 58.3% success rate (7/12 periods) + 6.3 trades/day

---

## 🎯 Major Learnings

### 1. **Don't Tunnel Vision on Same Parameters**

**Problem:** Initially only adjusted ATR_BIG, momentum filter, trend filter, and TP/SL repeatedly.

**What we missed:** Extended trading hours, ATR_SMALL adjustments, ATR_PERIOD changes, grid settings, signal invalidation toggling.

**Impact:** Only after user pointed out other parameters did we test extended hours (7-17) which became critical to HF9's success.

**Lesson:** When optimizing, systematically test ALL adjustable parameters, not just the "obvious" ones from previous rounds.

### 2. **Extended Trading Hours = "Free Lunch"**

**Discovery:** Extending hours from 8-16 to 7-17 increased trade frequency by +25% with NO quality degradation.

**Why it works:**
- Captures pre-London volatility (7-8 AM)
- Captures NY morning session (16-17 PM / 11 AM-12 PM ET)
- These hours have genuine trading opportunities, not just noise

**Previous assumption:** London session (8-16) was "optimal" from Round 2-6.
**Reality:** That was optimal for those specific 6 periods, not universally.

**Lesson:** Question "established" parameters when expanding test scope. What works for 6 selective periods may not be optimal for 12 diverse periods.

### 3. **Higher TP More Impactful Than Tighter SL**

**Testing:**
- TP 3.6 → 4.2: Converted 3 failing periods to passing (+25% ROI on successful trades)
- SL 0.3 → 0.25 → 0.2: Minimal impact on pass/fail rate

**Why:**
- 0.4% ROI threshold over 2 weeks is HIGH (10.4% annualized)
- Many periods had good PF (1.3-1.8) but ROI 0.28-0.37% (just under threshold)
- Higher TP pushed these over the line
- Tighter SL reduced losses but didn't change win rate enough

**Lesson:** When optimizing for ROI thresholds, prioritize TP increases over SL tightening. Risk:Reward ratio matters more than absolute risk.

### 4. **Trend Filters Hurt Consistency Across Diverse Periods**

**Testing:**
- L6 (MA 50 filter): 4/12 success, 38 trades/2-weeks
- HF8 (MA 40 filter): 5/12 success, 55 trades/2-weeks
- HF9 (no filter): 7/12 success, 88 trades/2-weeks

**Why filters hurt:**
- Different market structures (ranging, trending, choppy) favor different setups
- MA 50/40 removed too many valid signals in ranging/choppy periods (P5, P6)
- Didn't improve win rate enough to offset signal loss
- 12 diverse periods exposed this fragility

**Previous success:** L6 achieved 5/6 (83%) WITH MA 50 filter on selective periods.
**Reality:** Those 6 periods happened to be MA-filter-friendly. Broader testing revealed limitation.

**Lesson:** Filters that work on selective periods may hurt when expanding to diverse conditions. Simple often beats complex.

### 5. **Some Periods Are Structurally Unprofitable**

**Persistent failures across ALL 10 configs tested:**
- P1 (Jan 15 - Feb 1): Low volatility Q1 ranging - always negative
- P5 (May 1-15): Low volatility Q2 - always negative or break-even
- P12 (Nov 15-29): Low volatility Q4 ranging - always negative

**Key insight:** These aren't "fixable" with parameter tweaks. The strategy fundamentally doesn't work in low-volatility ranging markets.

**Options:**
1. Accept 58% "all-weather" performance
2. Add volatility filter (ATR < 0.4) to skip unsuitable conditions → 7/9 (77%)
3. Use dynamic config switching based on market regime

**Lesson:** Don't waste time optimizing for structurally incompatible market conditions. Either filter them out or accept lower success rate.

### 6. **Signal Invalidation Is Critical (Even If It Reduces Frequency)**

**Testing HF6 (invalidation disabled):**
- Dropped from 7/12 to 5/12 success
- Kept losing positions too long
- Higher average loss per trade
- Strategy got "stuck" in bad trades

**Impact of re-enabling:**
- Trade frequency reduced by ~18%
- But win rate improved significantly
- Net effect: +2 periods passing

**Lesson:** Core risk protections (like signal invalidation) should not be disabled to chase frequency targets. Quality > quantity when it comes to risk management.

### 7. **Grid Trading Doesn't Help 2-Week Period Testing**

**HF7 (grid enabled) vs HF4 (grid disabled):**
- Same 7/12 success rate
- No recovery benefit visible

**Why:**
- 2-week windows too short for grid recovery to play out
- Drawdowns that trigger grid entries often don't recover within test period
- Grid is designed for longer drawdown periods (monthly+)

**Lesson:** Test duration matters when evaluating features like grid trading. Short-term backtests may not capture long-term recovery mechanics.

### 8. **Parameter "Sweet Spots" Are Narrow**

**Examples:**
- ATR_SMALL: 0.3 works, 0.2 too permissive (-2 periods)
- ATR_PERIOD: 14 works, 12 too noisy (-2 periods)
- MIN_BODY_RATIO: 0.6 works, 0.7 too restrictive (-2 periods), 0.5 too permissive

**Implication:** Small parameter changes (10-20%) can swing success rate by ±2 periods (±17%).

**Lesson:** Don't assume "more extreme = better." Sweet spots exist, and overshooting them degrades performance. Test incrementally.

### 9. **Success Rate Depends Heavily on Success Criteria**

**Current criteria (PF > 1.3, ROI > 0.4%):**
- HF9: 7/12 (58.3%)

**If criteria were PF > 1.1, ROI > 0.3%:**
- HF9: 9/12 (75%)

**Why this matters:**
- 0.4% per 2 weeks = 10.4% annualized ROI
- PF > 1.3 = 30%+ edge
- These are VERY HIGH bars for diverse market conditions

**Lesson:** Document and justify success criteria. "Failing" to hit 60% with stringent criteria may be better than "achieving" 80% with loose criteria. Context matters.

### 10. **Selective Period Testing Creates Over-Optimistic Results**

**L6 performance:**
- 6 selective periods: 5/6 (83%)
- 12 diverse periods: 4/12 (33%)

**Why the drop:**
- Original 6 periods were cherry-picked for good performance over Rounds 1-6
- Inadvertent selection bias toward periods that favored the strategy
- 12 random periods included low-vol, adverse conditions

**Lesson:** Expand test sets progressively. Don't assume performance on selective periods generalizes to all conditions. Real-world deployment faces diverse conditions.

## 🎓 Methodology Lessons

### Testing Approach

**What worked:**
- Testing 12 random periods revealed config fragility
- Systematic testing of parameter ranges (HF4→HF10)
- Parallel comparison of configs
- JSON-based result parsing for accuracy

**What could be better:**
- Should have tested ALL parameters earlier (not just ATR_BIG, TP/SL)
- Could have used grid search / optimization algorithm
- Should have documented "why" for each parameter choice

### Config Iteration Strategy

**Pattern observed:**
1. HF-Interim (small tweaks): 5/12 → small improvement
2. HF4 (multiple changes): 7/12 → **breakthrough**
3. HF6 (too aggressive): 5/12 → regression
4. HF7 (add feature): 7/12 → no improvement
5. HF8 (re-add filter): 5/12 → regression
6. HF9 (extend hours): 7/12 → maintained, higher frequency

**Lesson:** Breakthroughs come from combining multiple complementary changes (HF4), not incremental single-parameter tweaks.

### Success Criteria Design

**Current criteria challenges:**
- PF > 1.3 AND ROI > 0.4% is very stringent
- 6 periods had PF 1.13-1.27 (profitable but "failing")
- Borderline periods (P6, P10) flip-flop with small tweaks

**Alternative approaches:**
1. **Composite score:** `(PF - 1.0) * ROI > threshold`
2. **Softer thresholds:** PF > 1.1, ROI > 0.3%
3. **Risk-adjusted:** `(PF - 1.0) / MaxDD > threshold`

**Lesson:** Success criteria should balance aspiration with realism. Current criteria may be over-optimized for "perfect" periods.

## 🚀 Recommendations for Future Rounds

### 1. **When Optimizing Next Time:**

✅ **DO:**
- Test ALL adjustable parameters systematically
- Question "established optimal" values when changing test scope
- Prioritize changes with high impact-to-effort ratio (extended hours, TP increases)
- Test diverse conditions (not just cherry-picked periods)
- Document rationale for each parameter choice

❌ **DON'T:**
- Tunnel vision on same parameters repeatedly
- Disable core risk protections to chase metrics
- Assume selective period success generalizes
- Make parameters too extreme (test incrementally)
- Waste time optimizing structurally incompatible conditions

### 2. **For Round 8+ (If Pursuing 60%+ Target):**

**Option A: Accept 58% as realistic "all-weather" performance**
- Deploy HF9 to demo account
- Monitor real-world performance
- Success criteria may be too stringent for diverse conditions

**Option B: Add volatility filter**
- Skip trading when ATR < 0.4 (low volatility)
- Would achieve 7/9 (77%) on viable periods
- Accept lower absolute trade count for higher success rate

**Option C: Dynamic config switching**
- Use L6 (high success) in trending markets
- Use HF9 (high frequency) in volatile markets
- Detect regime using ATR, ADX, or ML classifier

**Option D: Relax success criteria**
- PF > 1.1, ROI > 0.3% → Would achieve 9/12 (75%)
- Still profitable, just lower edge per period
- More realistic for diverse conditions

### 3. **Testing Infrastructure Improvements:**

- Add automated parameter grid search
- Track per-parameter impact matrix
- Implement A/B testing framework for parallel config evaluation
- Add market regime classification to results
- Track not just pass/fail but "distance from threshold"

### 4. **Parameter Prioritization for Round 8:**

**High-impact, untested:**
- LOT_SIZE variations (directly multiplies ROI)
- MAX_DRAWDOWN_PERCENT (may be limiting trades)
- Volume filters (if data available)
- Multi-timeframe confirmation

**Worth revisiting:**
- MA_PERIOD 30 (lighter than 40, heavier than none)
- SL trailing distance optimization
- Entry timing (ENTER_ON_OPEN variations)

**Probably not worth it:**
- Grid parameters (proven irrelevant for 2-week tests)
- ATR_SMALL < 0.3 (proven too permissive)
- Signal invalidation window fine-tuning (3 is optimal)

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### Trade-offs Are Real

**Frequency vs Quality:**
- L6: 2.7 trades/day, 83% success (selective periods)
- HF9: 6.3 trades/day, 58% success (diverse periods)

**Lesson:** There's no "perfect" config. Choose based on deployment goals:
- Want high win rate? Use L6 (conservative)
- Want high frequency? Use HF9 (aggressive)
- Want balanced? Test configs between them

### Selective vs Diverse Testing

**Selective periods (6):**
- Good for iterative improvement
- Fast to test
- Risk of overfitting

**Diverse periods (12):**
- Reveals robustness
- Slower to test
- More realistic expectations

**Lesson:** Use selective testing for development (Rounds 1-6), diverse testing for validation (Round 7). Both have value.

### Success Rate Expectations

**58% on 12 diverse periods with stringent criteria is actually strong:**
- Captures trending/volatile markets (target market)
- Avoids low-vol ranging (non-target market)
- Controlled drawdowns (<0.5% typical)
- 132% frequency increase achieved

**Lesson:** Context matters. 58% with PF > 1.3, ROI > 0.4%, 6.3 trades/day across diverse conditions may be better than 83% with PF > 1.3, ROI > 0.4%, 2.7 trades/day on selective conditions.

## 📝 Documentation Best Practices (Applied in Round 7)

### What We Did Well:

1. **Comprehensive result documentation** - Created detailed Round 7 markdown file
2. **Config tracking** - Each config (HF4-HF10) clearly documented with parameters
3. **Comparative analysis** - Side-by-side period-by-period comparison
4. **Lesson extraction** - This learnings document captures insights for future

### What Could Be Better:

1. **Per-config rationale** - Should document "why we think this will work" before testing
2. **Failed hypothesis tracking** - Explicitly note which assumptions were wrong
3. **Parameter sensitivity analysis** - Test ±10%, ±20% variations systematically
4. **Reproducibility** - Save exact command lines used for each config test

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Don't tunnel vision** - Systematically test all parameters, not just "obvious" ones
2. **Extended hours matter** - Capturing more market hours can be "free" performance boost
3. **Higher TP > tighter SL** - For ROI thresholds, profit targets matter more than stop losses
4. **Filters hurt consistency** - What works on selective periods may fail on diverse periods
5. **Some conditions unprofitable** - Accept structural limitations, don't over-optimize
6. **Protections are critical** - Signal invalidation worth the frequency cost
7. **Sweet spots are narrow** - Small parameter changes have big impacts
8. **Selective testing overfits** - Expand to diverse periods for realistic expectations
9. **Criteria matter** - Success rate depends heavily on how you define success
10. **Trade-offs are real** - Choose config based on goals (frequency vs quality)

---

## 📌 Bottom Line

**Round 7 achieved primary objective (frequency) but fell just short of 60% target.**

**Success:** 132% frequency increase (2.7 → 6.3 trades/day) while maintaining profitability.

**Challenge:** 58.3% success rate vs 60% target - just 1 period short.

**Recommendation:** Deploy Config HF9. The 1.7% gap is likely due to:
1. Stringent success criteria (PF > 1.3, ROI > 0.4% is high bar)
2. Diverse testing revealing structural limitations (low-vol periods)
3. Trade-off between frequency and consistency

**Alternative perspective:** 7/12 with these criteria may be more impressive than 10/12 with looser criteria. Quality metrics matter more than quantity.

**Next step:** Demo account validation to test real-world performance vs backtest assumptions.
